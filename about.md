I am a Full Stack Software Engineer specializing in Javascript with a passion for working on any and all parts of the stack.  I have a particular interest in the incredible modularity of programming, and am devoted to figuring out what technologies work together the best.  Whether the task at hand involves tracking down a particularly troublesome bug or ensuring that my team's work-flow is as smooth as possible, my simultaneous attention to detail and leadership qualities consistently produce the desired result.  Though I excel at integrating into teams, I am also excellent at working solo in an efficient, focused manner when the project requires it.
